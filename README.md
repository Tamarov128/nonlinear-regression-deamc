# Nonlinear Regression using the Differential Evolution with Adaptive Mutation and Crossover strategies

This notebook tries to replicate the algorithm presented in the paper by Wongsa, Watchara & Puphasuk [1], which introduces the DEAMC algorithm.  

## The structure of the repository:
- `nist_models`: Contains data about 15 NIST nonlinear regression models.
  - `data`
    - `raw/`: Contains original .dat files from NIST.
    - `processed/`: Contains extracted observations data.
    - `models/nist_models.json`: Contains extracted model parameters.
  - `scripts`
    - `preprocess_data.py`: Functions to extract data from raw files.
  - `models` 
    - `nist_models.py`: NISTModel class: extracts data and provides model methods.

- `notebooks`:
  - `nonlinear_regression_models.ipynb`: Notebook which describes nonlinear regression and analyzes the extracted NIST model data [3-5].  

  - `differential_evolution_adaptive_mutation_crossover.ipynb`: Notebook which describes the DE and DEAMC algorithms, implements DEAMC and tests it on the regression data.  

- `presentation`:
  - Contains a presentation on the work done (ppt and pdf formats).
