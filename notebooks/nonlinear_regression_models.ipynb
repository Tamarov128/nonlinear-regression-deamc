    "## What is nonlinear regression?\n",
    "Nonlinear regression is a statistical technique that helps describe nonlinear relationships in experimental data. The data are fitted by a method of successive approximations (iterations).  \n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, a nonlinear model is any model of the basic form, \n",
    "$$ y = f(\\vec{x};\\vec{\\beta}) + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "in which the functional part of the model is *not linear* with respect to the unknown parameters $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ...$  \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of nonlinear regression, the *method of least squares* is used to estimate the values of the unknown parameters. The goal is finding a vector estimate $\\hat{\\vec{\\beta}}$ which minimizes the residual sum of squares,\n",
    "$$ Q = \\sum_{i=1}^n [y_i - f(\\vec{x_i},\\hat{\\vec{\\beta}})]^2 $$"
